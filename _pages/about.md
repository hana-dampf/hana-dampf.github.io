I am a recent M.Sc. in Biostatistics graduate, having worked as a Research Associate at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at U of T and as a support specialist for Epic EMR implementations. My current focus is applying predictive and inferential statistics techniques to Canadian healthcare datasets and problems.
