title: Pablo Neural-da: I learn Python, as my model learns to love
categories: [Miscellaneous, Jekyll]

I think the best way to keep myself motivated in my goal of learning Python is to keep my side projects ridiculous. Working with natural language processing seems like a good way to A) keep myself humble and B) get my computer to spit out hilarious results.

I did this using the [Beautiful Soup library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for webscraping, and based my approach on Zach Thoutt's [LSTM model](https://github.com/zackthoutt/got-book-6)
