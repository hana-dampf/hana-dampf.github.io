So, how am I spending my free time these days? Very slowly learning Python. Working with natural language processing seems like a good way to A) keep myself humble and B) get my computer to spit out hilarious results.

I did this using the [Beautiful Soup library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for webscraping, and based my approach on Zach Thoutt's [LSTM model](https://github.com/zackthoutt/got-book-6), rewriting his tensorflow 1.0.0 RNN scheme in keras.
